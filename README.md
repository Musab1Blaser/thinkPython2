# ThinkPython2
This Repository contains the problem statements and code used in the [YouTube Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tael7BM79s&list=PLvxLkezVc4B9ZsgXklIZVquWrrG5-Jtem&ab_channel=MusabKasbati)
<br> <br>
Each weeks problems are in their respective folder <br>
Each folder is further broken down into folders containing the pdf of the problem statements and a folder with coded solutions. <br>
For those using this repository to develop their programming skills, it is highly recommended that you attempt each problem to the best of your abilities before turning to any of the solutions. <br> 
However, even if you solve a problem, it may benefit you to go over the provided solutions. <br> <br>
With that said. <br>
_Happy Programming!_
